# EGEN310-prototype2
Code for the prototype 2 control app.

This project contains a java class for the main GUI window written by me, plus a free to use utility class that is commonly used with
java SWT (the libraries used to design this interface).

Dependencies: included in the lib folder is the swt.jar file (org.eclipse.swt.win32.win32.x86_64_3.113.0.v20191204-0601.jar) which is needed to run the GUI.
